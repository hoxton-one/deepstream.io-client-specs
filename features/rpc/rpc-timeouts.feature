@rpc
Feature: Providing RPC
	Remote Procedure Calls are deepstream's concept of request-response communication. This requires
	a client that makes the RPC (requestor or receiver) and another client that answers it (provider)

Scenario: The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the client logs in with username XXX and password YYY
		And the server sends the message A|A+

# Making

Scenario: The client makes an RPC
	When the client requests RPC toUppercase with data abc
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|REQ|toUppercase|<UID>|Sabc+

Scenario: The client receives a timeout
	When some time passes
	Then the client recieves an error RPC callback for toUppercase with the message "RESPONSE_TIMEOUT"

# Providing

Scenario: The client provides a RPC
	When the client provides a RPC called toUppercase
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|S|toUppercase+

@timeout
Scenario: The server does not respond in time with an ACK
	When some time passes
	Then the client throws a ACK_TIMEOUT error with message No ACK message received in time for toUppercase

# Unproviding

Scenario: The client stops providing a RPC
	When the client stops providing a RPC called toUppercase
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|US|toUppercase+

@timeout
Scenario: The server does not respond in time with an ACK
	When some time passes
	Then the client throws a ACK_TIMEOUT error with message No ACK message received in time for toUppercase
